# 5G-based System-level Integrated Sensing and Communication Simulator
## STILL UNDER DEVELOPING and DEBUGGING
## NOTE: R2023a or above is NOT available for this simulator

## Incooperates the following parts:<br>
###  Scenario generation,<br>
    Based on the OpenStreetMapâ„¢ open-source data
###  Multi-node ISAC network simulation,<br>
    Focus on implementing key techniques of ISAC
###  Communication simulation functions (MIMO), including:<br>
    APP layers modeling
    RLC layers modeling
    MAC layers modeling
    PHY layers modeling
    CDL channel modeling
    Pathloss modeling
    Simulation visualization tools
### Sensing simulation functions (mono-static sensing), including:<br>
    Echo modeling
    Mono-static sensing modeling
    Detection algorithms (2D-CFAR)
    Estimation algorithms (2D-FFT and MUSIC)


### Initial members participated in this project:<br>
    D. Xue, J. Wei, Y. Li, T. Zeng,
    Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,
    Beijing, P. R. China.


## MATLAB version and toolboxes required: 
    R2019(not tested)-R2022, (IMPORTANT NOTE: R2023a and above is not available!) 
    5G Toolbox, Phased Array System Toolbox, Wireless Communication Toolbox.


## Getting Started
    To simulate the system-level ISAC scenario,
    first, deploy the scenario in the 'scenarios' folder,
    and then locate the corresponding file name in the 'launcherFiles' folder to run the simulation.


## Documentation
    None at present.
